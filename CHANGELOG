    + Added 'reverse' option to constructor
    + Cleaned up code a bit
    + Only update items when needed (subText was being updated even if it had not changed).
    + Pre-compute lengths and use static value rather than calling length() ever iteration.

4/8/2002
    + Removed the 'no MODULE;' calls since Perl 5.6.0 has problems
      with it.

4/3/2002
    + Fixed problem for Perl 5.6.0 where a 'no MODULE' call
      would not work.

4/2/2002
	+ Fixed code in new() that determines screen width and 
	  appropriate adjustments to make. Now takes all text 
	  length into account when determining the 'scale'.

	+ Fixed setItems() so that updateInc does not contain 
	  decimals.

	+ Added ability to set sub-text below the status bar.

4/1/2002
	+ Added a README and CHANGELOG file
