    Term::StatusBar - Dynamic progress bar

SYNOPSIS
        use Term::StatusBar;

        my $status = new Term::StatusBar (
                        label => 'My Status: ',
                        totalItems => 10,  ## Equiv to $status->setItems(10)
        );

        $status->start;  ## Optional, but recommended

        doSomething(10);

        $status->reset;  ## Resets internal state
        $status->label('New Status: ');  ## Reuse current object with new data
        $status->char('|');

        doSomething(20);

        sub doSomething {
            $status->setItems($_[0]);
            for (1..$_[0]){
                sleep 1;
                $status->update;  ## Will call $status->start() if needed
            }
        }

DESCRIPTION
    Term::StatusBar provides an easy way to create a terminal status bar,
    much like those found in a graphical environment. Term::Size is used to
    ensure the bar does not extend beyond the terminal's width. All outout
    is sent to STDOUT by default.

METHODS
  new(parameters)
    This creates a new StatusBar object. It can take several parameters:

       startRow     - This indicates which row to place the bar at. Default is 1.
       startCol     - This indicates which column to place the bar at. Default is 1.
       label        - This places text to the left of the status bar. Default is "Status: ".
       scale        - This indicates how long the bar is. Default is 40.
       totalItems   - This tells the bar how many items are being iterated. Default is 1.
       char         - This indicates which character to use for the base bar. Default is ' ' (space).
       updateInc    - Updates bar every X%. Default is every 1%.
       subText      - Text to display below the status bar.
       subTextAlign - How to align subText ('left', 'center', 'right').
       reverse      - Status bar empties to 0% rather than fills to 100%.
       barColor     - Base color of the status bar (default white -- \e[7;37m).
       fillColor    - Fill color of the status bar (default blue -- \e[7;34m).
       fh           - User-defined file handle.
       precision    - Formats percentage with decimals. Up to 4 places supported.
       showTime     - Shows approximate time to completion in "00:00:00" format.

  setItems(#)
    This method does several things with the number that is passed in. First
    it sets $obj->{totalItems}, second it sets an internal counter
    'curItems', last it determines the update increment.

    This method must be used, unless you pass totalItems to the constructor.

  subText('text')
    Sets subText and redisplays it if necessary.

  addSubText('text')
    This takes the original value of $obj->{subText} and concats 'text' to
    it each time it is called. Text is then re-displayed to screen.

  start()
    This method 'draws' the initial status bar on the screen.

  update()
    This is really the core of the module. This updates the status bar and
    gives the appearance of movement. It really just redraws the entire
    thing, adding any new incremental updates needed.

  reset([\%options])
    This resets the bar's internal state and makes it available for re-use.
    If the optional hash ref is passed in, the status bar can be filled with
    specified values. The keys are interpreted as function calls on the
    status bar object with the values as parameters.

  _printPercent()
    Internal method to print the current percentage to the screen.

  _printSubText()
    Internal method to print the subText to the screen.

CHANGES
       2003-05-06
          Fixed bug where subTextLength was not being re-evaluated.
          Bar's final state color is now appropriate. When emptied to 0% is was getting re-filled.
          Added "no warnings 'portable" so Perl 5.8 would be happy.
          Added ability to send output to user-defined file handle.
          Added precision for percentage output to a max of 4 decimal places. Default is 0.
          Can now specify a different 'updateInc', which adjusts how often the bar is updated. Default is every 1%.
          Can now indicate if you want to see approximate time to completion.  

       2003-01-27
          Added 'reverse' option to constructor.
          Cleaned up code a bit.
          Only update items when needed (subText was being updated even if it had not changed).
          Pre-compute lengths and use static value rather than calling length() every iteration.
